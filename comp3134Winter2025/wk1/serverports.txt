What is the definition of server port?

Server ports range from 0 to 65,535, and they are divided into three categories:

ðŸ”¹ Well-Known Ports (0 - 1023): These are reserved for essential services like web servers, email, and DNS.
ðŸ”¹ Registered Ports (1024 - 49,151): Used by applications and software that require a dedicated communication channel.
ðŸ”¹ Dynamic/Private Ports (49,152 - 65,535): Assigned temporarily for short-lived connections.

How many bits does the number above represent?
A server port number is represented using 16 bits. Since 16-bit numbers range from 0 to 65,535, this explains why port numbers stop at 65,535.
